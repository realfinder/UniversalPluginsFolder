Feedback
========

Feedback is a pair of filters that allow the output of a filter chain to be
passed back as an input, further up the chain, to be used in outputting the next
frame of the chain.

For example, it can be used to fill in the empty areas of a stablised clip by
compositing in the previous output frame (which itself will have been composited
using Feedback).

Usage
=====

FeedbackInput(
  (clip),
  (int) id
)

FeedbackOutput(
  (clip),
  (int) id
)

FeedbackInput will return frame 0 of its input clip as frame 0 of its output,
but after that it returns frame n-1 of the associated FeedbackOutput clip.

FeedbackOutput sets a clip as a source for a FeedbackInput clip.

The id parameter is optional, but must be given unique values whenever there is
more than one FeedbackInput/FeedbackOutput set in a script environment.

Example
=======

Assume that you have a clip, with an alpha channel, that has been stabilised and
so has a moving black border around the stabilised image. Then you can composite
the stabilised clip on top of its previous frames by doing the following:

    Layer(stab.FeedbackInput(), stab).FeedbackOutput()

Frame 0 of the resulting clip will just be frame 0 of "stab" composited on itself.

Frame 1 will be frame 1 of "stab" composited on the previously composited frame (0)

Frame n will be frame n of "stab" composited on the previously composited frame (n-1)

Caveats
=======

Linear access is fast - FeedbackOutput keeps a copy of the previously-output
frame - but non-linear access will be slow as it will need to traverse all the
way back to the beginning of the FeedbackOutput clip.

Using Trim, or any other filter which changes the relative frame numbers of a
clip (e.g. ChangeFps or SelectEven) is probably not a good idea and could lead
to hangs or other strange behaviour.
