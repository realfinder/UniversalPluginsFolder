	UnsharpMask16Y
	------

Y-channel unsharp masking using a 16-bit bicubic blurred clip.

Parameters:
	mask: clip - 16-bit blur mask clip (bitdepth=16).
	edges: float - edges sharpening amount.
	g: float - gamma correction for sharpening.
	wg: float - gamma correction for a white areas halo protection.
	bl: float - black level offset.
	str: float - sharpening strength.
	mode: int - 8-bit filter mode: 0=truncate (offset is possible), 1=dither.
	bitdepth: int - filter bitdepth: 8,88,16,32

Example:
	UnsharpMask16Y(mask, edges=1.0, g=2.2, wg=1.0, bl=0.0, str=1.0, mode=1, bitdepth=8)

	mask: clip - 8-bit blur mask clip.
	edges: float - edges sharpening amount.
	g: float - gamma correction for sharpening.
	wg: float - gamma correction for a white areas halo protection.
	bl: float - black level offset.
	str: float - sharpening strength.
	mode: int - 8-bit filter mode: 0=truncate (offset is possible), 1=dither.
	bitdepth: int - filter bitdepth: 8,88,16,32

	HDR Plugin Set
	--------------

This filter pack is a part of the HDR Plugin Set.
You can download another HDR plugins from this page:
http://www.snovidenie.com/plugins/hdr/

If you want to maintain my interest in development and technical support, please purchase
the full plugin set. You can get high quality color correction filters, including
3D LUT 32-bit filter that reads *.cube or *.3dl files.
