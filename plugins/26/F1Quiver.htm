<p>This plugin function filters the image row by row, in 1d frequency domain. 
Filters can be either Gaussian, 
or Butterworth or custom designed in frequency domain. Noise that appears
vertically or sub vertically aligned (noise really is  row wise) is filtered.</p>

<P> Standard filters included are low cut (high pass), highcut (low pass), band stop, band pass
and notch reject filters of either Gaussian or Butterworth type. Up to 15 of these standard filters 
can be cascaded. Filter can also be custom (user) designed. Cascading custom designed
 filters with standard filters is not  allowed.  The custom designed filter 
 is smoothed by 5 point average. </P>

<P>Each Standard filter is specified by 4 integer set:
<BR> First integer value 1.  low cut (high pass) 2. high cut or (low pass), or 3 band pass or 4. band stop or 5 
 notch (reject).
<BR>The Second  value  is  the frequency 1 , 50% amplitude cut off 
 or center
frequency of notch  filter. 
<BR>The third value is freq2 value to be used for band pass or band stop
 and must be specified even if not relevant.</P>
<BR>The fourth value if 0 then Gaussian Filter. Otherwise degree of sharpness of Butterworth filter.
<P>Upto 15 X 4 such values can be specified. Each filter cascades over other </P>

<P>Alternatively by opting for Custom, filter is specified by a sereis of 
frequency and amplitude pairs . The first amplitude value is back ward propogated 
upto zero freq, and the last pair amplitude is propogated up to the nyquist 
frequency. The frequency values must increase monotonically. The custom filter is smoothed
with 5 point average ..</P>

<p>A test facility is included as an option. In this option, in one half of frame, the averaged power spectrum of specified 
row(s) is shown in two panels, top one with gamma scale and filter profile, and below a unscaled version. 
In the other half of frame  the image unfiltered or
if  standard filter sets,or  custom filter is specified, then filtered image is displayed. 
 A  horizontal ruler with graduations (100s, 50s and 10s) assist in specifying frequency values. </p>

<P>The spectral display will be averaged spectrum of starting row to end row.
This smmothes out a lot of noise and brings out persistent frequencies.</P>
 
<p>Presence of sharp high amplitude objects (such as logos) can create severe
ringing due to filtering. A sharp discontinuity requires all frequencies of 
spectrum to be present. Any filtering that affects the balance can create
undesirable ringing. If possible cropping and re joining after processing may
be useful in those cases.</p>

<P>With the option 'morph'  set to true, homomorphic filtering can be done.</P>
<p>Only YUY2 and Planar (YV12 only by version 2.5) formats are acceptable. Y values only are processed
by F1Quiver .</p>
