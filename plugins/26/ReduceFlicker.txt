## ReduceFlicker for Avisynth2.6/Avisynth+
	This is a rewite of ReduceFlicker which written by Rainer Wittmann.
	This plugin has only ReduceFlicker(). ReduceFluctuation() and LockClense() are not implemented.

### Requirements:
	- avisynth2.60/avisynth+r1576 or later.
	- WindowsVista sp2 or later.
	- Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015.

### Syntax:
	ReduceFlicker(clip, int "strength", bool "aggressive", bool "grey", int "opt")

#### clip:
	All planar formats(YV24/YV16/YV12/YV411/Y8) are supported.

#### strength:
	Specify the strength of ReduceFlicker. Higher values mean more aggressive operation.

	1 - makes use of 4(current + 2*previous + 1*next) frames .
	2(default) - makes use of 5(current + 2*previous + 2*next) frames.
	3 - makes use of 7(current + 3*previous + 3*next) frames.

#### aggressive:
	If set this to true, then a significantly more aggressive variant of the algorithm is selected.
	Default value is false.

#### grey:
	Whether chroma planes will be processed or not. If set this to true, chroma planes will be garbage.
	Default value is false.

#### opt:
	Controls which cpu optimizations are used.
	Currently, this filter has three(C++, SSE2 and AVX2) routines.

	0 - use C++ routine.
	1(default) - use SSE2 routine.
	2 - use AVX2 routine.

	If you are using Avisynth2.60, you shouldn't set this to 2.
	Avisynth+ has no problem.

### Lisence:
	GPLv2 or later.
