<h2>Information</h2>

<p>UnBlock is a filter that removes the "blockiness" of heavily or moderately compressed images with statistical approach.</p>
<p>It is spatial filter for blocks with size 8x8. </p>
<p>Like other deblocking filters, Unblock must be applyed before crop (left, top if not mod 8), resize, denoise and other filters 
which may modify block boudaries.
</p>
<p>UnBlock does not require any user input:
the algorithm determines which edge transitions are (most likely to be) blocking artifacts by
analyzing the image itself. It automatically corrects image as far as possible.
</p>

<p> Plugin uses deblocking algorithm and code library developed by John Costella.
 See  <a href="http://www.assassinationscience.com/johncostella/unblock/">his web page</a> 
 for very detailed information.
From the original paper: </p>
<p><code>We don't have the original image, so we can't be sure
that there isn't a sharp discontinuity in the original image that happens to lie right on the
boundary. If we removed all discrepancies unconditionally, we would automatically blur out
any such sharp edge that happens to unfortunately fall in the wrong place.
It is impossible to avoid such an error in every possible case, but we can do so statistically.
 For any given image, the distribution of the magnitudes of the block boundary discontinuity
errors will be determined by the amount of compression employed (the "quality factor").
By computing the distribution of boundary discrepancies across the entire image, and comparing
it to the distribtuion of "discrepancies" calculated in the interior of the blocks, we can
quantify, statistically, the amount to which the compression has introduced block artifacts.
Now, what are we to do with these statistical distributions? A reasonable ansatz is that
we should reduce each boundary discrepancy by an amount that will make the interior and
boundary discrepancy distributions the same, as far as possible.

 </p>
 
<p> In my (Fizick) opinion, the algorithm is really good for strong blockiness 
but is not very safe for weak blockiness - it can partially destroy some thin image details.

<h2>Syntax and parameters</h2>

<p><code>Unblock</code> (<var>clip, bool "chroma", bool "photo", bool "cartoon")</var></p>

<p>first parameter is the source clip.</p>

<p><var>chroma</var>  - Set this flag to <var>false</var> to not deblock chroma. Default=true.</p>

<p><var>photo</var> - Set this flag to <var>true</var> if you know for certain that the
image is "photographic" (i.e., continuous tone). This tells Unblock to
be somewhat more aggressive in removing block artifacts; more accurately, it leans to
the "aggressive" side of its statistical confidence interval. Default=false.</p>

<var>cartoon</var> - Set this flag to <var>true</var> if you know for certain that the image is
"cartoon-like" (i.e., solid blocks of color with sharp boundaries between them). This
tells Unblock to be somewhat less aggressive in removing block artifacts;
more accurately, it leans to the "conservative" side of its statistical confidence interval.
Default=false.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
loadplugin("unblock.dll")
avisource("g:\test.avi")
converttoYV12()
unblock(cartoon=true)
