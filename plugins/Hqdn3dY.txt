Hqdn3dY by Andrew Revvo 2016

Based on HQDN3D 0.11 by Loren Merritt, Copyright 2005.
Based on the MPlayer filter with the same name, by Daniel Moreno.

Andrew Revvo note:
I made it compatible with Y8 and planar color spaces because I need fast
denoised masks and fast denoise.

Usage:
Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
or
Hqdn3d16Y(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)

sp: (default=4.0)
	luma spatial filter strength.
tp: (default=6.0)
	luma temporal filter strength.

Currently this way only (and intended) is possible to use it:

	y = ConvertToY8()
	u = UToY8()
	v = VToY8()
	y = y.Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
	u = u.Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
	v = v.Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
	YToUV(u,v,y)

Or for a RGB source for a noise reduction in R, G, B:

	r = ShowRed("Y8")
	g = ShowGreen("Y8")
	b = ShowBlue("Y8")
	r = r.Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
	g = g.Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
	b = b.Hqdn3dY(sp=10.0, tp=0.0)
	MergeRGB(r,g,b)

You can view a channel denoise result and tweak it by entering a channel clip variable (y,u,v,r,g,b) after this code.

Original readme:

High Quality DeNoise 3D is an Avisynth 2.5 filter.
It performs a 3-way low-pass filter, which can completely remove
high-frequency noise while minimizing blending artifacts.


Notes:
Due to the linear nature of this filter, combined with  the need to make the
result of a given frame independent of seeking, hqdn3d will run very slowly if
you continually request frames out of order.
However, when operating linearly, it can process 720x480 at about 80fps
on my Barton 2500.

This filter works only in the YV12 colorspace, simply because I haven't
bothered to code a YUY2 version.


Usage:
hqdn3d(clip, float ls, float cs, float lt, float ct, int restart)

ls: (default=4.0)
	luma spatial filter strength.
cs: (default=3.0)
	chroma spatial filter strength.
lt: (default=6.0)
	luma temporal filter strength.
ct: (default=4.5)
	chroma temporal filter strength.
restart: (default=lt+1)
	Whenever a frame is requested out of order, restart filtering this many
frames before. While seeking still slightly affects the content of the frames
returned, this should reduce the disturbance to an unnoticable level. 

Filter strengths vary from 0 (no filtering) to 255 (there will be nothing left
of your video).
If any options are omitted, they will assume a value based on any other
options that you did specify. For example, hqdn3d(2) is equivalent to
hqdn3d(2,1.5,3,2.25).
