Call.dll v1.3

Conceived by DDogg, thrown together badly by Nic

To Use:
LoadPlugin("D:\plugin\call.dll")
Call("d:\besweet\besweet.exe -core( -input d:\matrix\matrix.ac3 -output d:\matrix\matrix.mp3 )", "0")

This will do the command on frame 0
if you want to do things on multiple frames seperate with a comma or semicolon
i.e.
Call("d:\besweet\besweet.exe", "0,20,50")
will do the call on frames 0, 20 and 50. Using the number -1 will make it do it on the very last frame!

New Features !! :
----------------

1)
To get Call to operate before any encoding starts is to specify a clip and the 
frame number as -2
i.e.
LoadPlugin("call.dll")
Call(BlankClip, "lame --decode fatboy.mp3 fatboy.wav", "-2")
WavSource("fatboy.wav")

The above script will convert fatboy.mp3 into fatboy.wav and then load it :)
(BlankClip is very useful here :) )

2)
If you need to put in " for long file names put in single quotes as apostrophes ' and that should now
work. i.e. Call(BlankClip, "lame --decode 'e:\my rip dir\fatboy.mp3' fatboy.wav", "-2")

3)
NicEcho can be used for outputting stuff.
use as:
Call(BlankClip, "d:\nicecho.exe d:\report.txt 'Hello world how are you?\nCarriage Return'", "-2")
Remember the single quotes around the test!
If you want to append to an already existing file prefix the file name with a @
i.e.
Call(BlankClip, "d:\nicecho.exe @d:\report.txt 'Appending'", "-2")

Notes:
1) REMEMBER THE QUOTES FOR THE SECOND PARAMETER (i.e. its not an integer input but a string!)
2) REMEMBER THAT THE PROGRAM YOUR CALLING MUST CLOSE ITSELF AFTER PROCESSING. OTHERWISE THE ENCODE
   WILL GET STUCK UNTIL YOU CLOSE IT MANUALLY!
3) REMEMBER TO PUT IN FULL PATHS TO YOUR PROGRAM. TO TEST YOUR PATH, GO START->RUN THEN TRY IT FROM
   THERE TO MAKE SURE IT WILL WORK.

(sorry for the shouting, but I say it just to make you read it ;) )

PS
CALL_25.dll is the AviSynth 2.5 version! :)
