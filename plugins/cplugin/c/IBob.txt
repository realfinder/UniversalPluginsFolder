Interpolating Bob 0.10

Copyright 2003 Kevin Atkinson under the GPL 2.0

It requires version by Avisynth C API Plugin version 0.14 or better.
The required dll, avisynth_c.dll, is included.  You can find the full
version at http://kevin.atkinson.dhs.org/avisynth_c/.

This simple filter works identically to the Avisynth builtin Bob filter
except that it uses linear interpolation instead of bicubic resizing.
It usage is simple:
  IBob()

The advantages of IBob over the builtin Bob is:

1) The lines of the dominate field are untouched.  In particular
   
    assumetff()
    orig = last
    ibob()
    assumetff().separatefields().selectevery(4,0,3).weave()
    compare(last,orig)

Will report 0 difference between the original and the bob than unbobed
video (when the video format is yuy2, with yv12 the chroma will be
slightly different).  With the builtin bob this is not the case.

2) A bit faster than the builtin bob.

In can be made even faster by 1) dynamically compiling key parts to
reduce register pressure and take advantage of the "base + index +
displacement" addressing mode, and by 2) using vector extensions.
