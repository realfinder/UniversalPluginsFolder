This filter equalize total luminosity in pairs of even and odd lines.
The filter preserves all details (no smoothing or deinterlacing).

    Apllication:
    
The simple filter is useful for removing of inter-line difference
from captured (telecined) 8mm films (kino, movie).
The well-known Antiflicker filter (by Donald Graft) make a good job
in frames luminosity equalizing, but may to leave some inter-field differences,
which are revealed after restoring of a progressive frames sequence
(with Telecide and Decimate filters from Decomb plugin by Donald Graft).
The EquLines filter must apllied after them all.
But any denoising filters must be applied after Equlines.

Works only with Avisynth C Interface (avithynth_c.dll) by Kevin Atkinson.
Based on his example filter "invert_luma_in_place"

   Using:

Avisource("file.avi")
Loadplugin("avisynth_c.dll")
LoadCplugin("EquLines.dll")
EquLines(deltamax=120)
  
Optional parameter Deltamax is the maximum of luminisity change (default=255)
Filter needs YUY2 or YV12
