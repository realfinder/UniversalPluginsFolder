Zoom plugin (Pan/Zoom/Rotate) 

As there is often the need for moving a video around I made a plugin for this. (it should help shorten some of Wilbert's monster-Animate-scripts). 

It has the following syntax: 

Zoom(string "srcx", string "srcy", string "dstx", string "dsty", string "factorX", string "factorY", string "factor", string "angle", int "height", int "width", bool "show") 

As you see there are no number arguments. You can insert every script function AviSynth knows of which returns a number. 

srcx/srcy are the "center" coordinates in the original frame, 
dstx/dsty are the center coordinates in the moved frame, 
factorX, factorY are the magnification factors, 
factor can be used to set both (factorX and factorY) to the same value at once,
angle is the rotation angle in degrees. 
height, width are the new image dimensions
show prints the calculated values on the image

Sounds complicated? 
Not really, try this: 

version().converttorgb32().zoom(dstx="n", angle="n") 

Here you see that the variable "n" can be used to reference to the current frame number (and this is of course the most important thingie). 

Or try: 

version().converttorgb32() 
zoom(factorx="n<41 ? pow((n+1)/41,0.5) : 1", factory="n<41 ? pow((n+1)/41,0.5) : 1", dstx="n<41 ? width/2 : width/2+5*(n-41)", angle="n<41 ? 18*n : 0") 

Or do you want to shake:
version().converttorgb32()
zoom(dsty="rand(10)+height/2", dstx="rand(10)+width/2")


And the new image gets a defined alpha layer (black=transparent, else opaque), so you can layer the result on top of another video. 


Of course it can be used e.g. as plain rotate: 

e.g. Zoom(angle="45") will do nothing but rotate your image by 45 degrees. 


This was the good news. 

The bad news: 

-only RGB32 (I want to use alpha) 
-quite slow (but it's only a trick filter for not so many frames) 
-the down resizer is quite poor (something like a point resize)

<2005-01-22> the alpha channel is no longer treated differently (previously it was set to opaque when not black)
