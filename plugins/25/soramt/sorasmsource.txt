Sorry for poor English.

You can also refer the examples to know how/when to use.


This package contains 3 things:

sorathread.dll
sorasmsource.dll
sroasmserver.exe

build with
windows 7 professional
visual c++ 2010 express
boost 1.48
lua 5.2


I'll give a simple explain about these.


1

sorathread.dll provides a function,
to separate the processing before and after into 2 stand-alone threads.
To use more then 2 threads,
call SoraThread multiple times in appropriate position.

Aims at speeding up the script by making use of cpu with multiple cores.


SoraThread(Clip c, Integer Buffer, Integer Cache, String Prefetch, Bool CopyData)


Buffer is the number of buffers to prefetch frames, (default: 5)

Cache is the number of caches to preserve processed frames. (default: 0)
    I wonder if cache is really needed... just offered.
    Because plugins that will refer previous frames probably has it's own cache.

buffer and cache are on the expense of memory usage.

Prefetch is a lua script to specified a algorithm to have prefetch down
(default: none. simplely read the next n frames)
    In the lua script, global variable FrameCount is given, refer to the
    number of total frames. Each time SoraThread prefetches a frame, it
    calls GetNextFrame function with the parameter "current frame number"
    in the script to get which frame to prefetch
    Refer to the example in "doc" folder.

CopyData decides whether the prefetched frame will be copied to the buffer
    instead of saving a smart pointer. It will significantly slow down the
    speed, use more memory.
    It's just a try towards crashes. (default: false)

(some filter may refer to previous frames so I use a cache)


2

sorasmsource.dll and sorasmserver.exe

they provide a way to separate the processing into multiple processes.
sorasmserver is a stand-alone process which provides frames for sorasmsource.

SoraSMSource(String name_for_shared_memory)

SoraSMServer.exe name_for_shared_memory avs_script_file

Aims at solving the problem of 32-bit process's memory limit.

In the expense of inter-processes communication,
the maximum speed of script is limited.
for example, a max speed of about 250 fps on my computer.
