BicublinResize.dll - Beta 1 - by MarcFD

this is a set of resamplers for avisynth 2.5
needs YV12 and a ISSE capable cpu (doing a MMX-version is easy)
all the resamplers here are unfiltered ones, this means
they're damn fast, but far from perfect, because they use a
small number of sampling points. anyway, for normal tasks, they
may perfectly suits you ^^

BTW, it's important to test it and to let YOUR eyes decide.
because even if it's not real full filtered interpolation,
it looks very decent anyway, really.

Syntax :
FastBilinearResize(h,v)
FastBicubicResize(h,v,b,c)
BicublinResize(h,v,b,c)

FastBilinear is like trbarry's simpleresize
FastBicubic is a unfiltered Bicubic resampler
Bicublin use bicubic on Y plane and bilinear on UV planes.

h,v = horizontal and vertical resolutions.
b,c = bicubic coefficients. by default : b=1/3,c=1/3
