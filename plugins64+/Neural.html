	  <p>If one has an input video and one frame of it processed to get a desired
	  image ( noise free or some other feature) then Neural network can be trained on that particular input frame and output target frame to get internal processing to match. For example if a 5x5 grid is used on that particular frame (with unknown weights)
	  to get the target output then Neural learns by training  how to get the nearest output</p> 
	  
	  <p>This Neural function assumes that the first frame of the input video was 
	  processed to get the first frame of the training clip. A  window on the frame (that has all the range of amplitudes) is used for training. Starting with random weights for each input nodes through number of iterations the weights are adjusted with Resilient algorithm. This training may take several seconds to a few minutes.</p>

<P> After training these weights are used to process the entire video including the first frame. In case of RGB input, which color component be used for training can be specified. For YUV formats training is done on Y component only. While all 3 components of RGB formats are processed , in case of YUV if opted, and there is no subsampling U and V also are processed</P>
<P> In some situations the error during each iteration may reach a local minimum and diverge. Best weights are stored for usage. In rare cases starting weights may not be suitable, in which case one can choose trying with several different starting weights and use those that give least error. Also instead of the inbuilt random numbers, a different seed can be used. However it should be borne in mind that the tme for learning will increase.Normally one may not need them.</P> 	  
<P>Training window needs to be as small as possible to minimise time, but needs to encompass all possible range of values. A minimum 100x100 is accepted. If target frame was processed with a x y grid, then xpts must be a minimum of x and ypts be a minimum of y</P>	  
	
<p>Packed RGB ( 8 and 16 bit), YUY2 and 8, 10 to 16 or 32 bit  Planar formats are supported. This is thread safe. MT_NICE_FILTER</p>
