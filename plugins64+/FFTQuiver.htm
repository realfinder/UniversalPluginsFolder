	  <p> FFTQuiver plugins for Avisynth 2.5.8 and 2.6 versions and avisynth+ are  free for use, under GPL
	  with no gaurentees or warranties neither
	   explicit nor implied. Use of this plugin is  entirely at users risk.	   
	    </p>	   
	  
	  <p> FQuiver and FFTQuiver plugins are similar except that FQuiver is self contained
	  while FFTQuiver <b>requires</b><a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3.zip">libFFTw3f-3.dll</a> 
	  or <a href=" http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3_64bit.zip"> 64 bit libFFTw3f-3.dll</a> , and is faster. These FFT dlls are from FFTW.org. </P>
<P>	  FFTQuiver plugin has two main
	  functions: <a href="F1Quiver.htm">F1Quiver</a>, <a href="F2Quiver.htm">F2Quiver</a>. To visulize the frequency spectra and crrectly specify filters, two supporting functions are also included. These are F1QTest and F2QTest. These have identical parameters with the processing functions for ease of scripting.</P> 
	  .
	   <BR><a href="F1Quiver.htm">F1Quiver and F1QTest</a> transforms image
	  data row by row into one dimensional spatial frequency domain.<BR> 
	   <a href="F2Quiver.htm">F2Quiver and F2QTest</a> as the name  implies converts whole 
	   of image through a 2d transform into spatial frequency domain.<BR>
	  
	  <p>These  functions have	   
	   a large number of cascadable frequency domain Gaussian and 
	  Butterworth filters for image processing.F1Quiver has a custom filter facility also. Homomorphic filtering can also be done
	  with these  functions.<BR> YUY2 and all Planar (Yv12 only in 2.5 version) color formats only are supported
	  by these  functions.</p>
	  
	  <p>A quiver is a carrying case of a bunch of arrows used by hunters in olden
	  times. As this plugin has a large number of filters, this name was chosen. I am
	  reminded of an excellent book titled 'A quiver full of arrows ' by Jeffry Archer.</p>
	  
	  <p>Comments, suggestions and bug reports may please be addressed to me by 
	  either <a href="mailto:mohanvc@gmail.com">mohanvc</a> or through the 
	  excellent doom9 forum avisynth usage threads.</p>
