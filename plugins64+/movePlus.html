	  <p>This plugin has 3 functions, which move pixels to new locations either for correcting for distortions or rotating. These functions were originally coded as individual plugins for avisynth. Due to recent changes in avisynth+ capabilities, these functions were put together, modified and updated.
		All these functions are thread safe. (MT_NICE_FILTER )	  
	  </p>
		
	  <P> The functions in this plugin are:
	  <BR> 1. <a href="Turn.html">Turn</a> : Turns the image through given degrees about a specified fulcrum
	  <BR> 2. <a href="Reform.html">Reform</a> : Converts a quadrilateral image into rectangular one or vice versa.
		<BR>3. <a href="Barrel.html">Barrel</a> : Due to sphericity of the lenses used in cameras, either Barrel type or Pin cushion type distortions are often seen in images. This Function corrects these distortions.
		
	  All these functions can be used for bit depths 8 to 16 as well as float formats. These are thread safe MT_NICE_FILTER
