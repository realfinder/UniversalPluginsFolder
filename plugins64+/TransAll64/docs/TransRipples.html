	  <P>Two water ripples  from opposite positions( east and west, or north and south or north east and south west or north west and south east) of frame and gradually spread over the   Left Clip during one third of  overlap length. During the next one third two ripples of the Right Clip emerge from opposite positions of the left frame ripples and fully cover the frame.The two right frame ripples ripples subside during last one third of overlap. The 
	   wave length lambda and wave amplitude may be specified. Location of 
	   ripples centers 
	   
	   The speed of spreading of ripple over the frame can be specified. Lowest is 2 where 
	   the ripple spreads in half the number of overlapping frames, to a value overlap/3. 
		
 	  RGB32, RGB24 YV12 and YUY2 colorspaces only are supported by 2.5 version. The 2.6 version plugin supports all avisynth supported formats viz Planar, RGB, YUY2, Y8. </p>
