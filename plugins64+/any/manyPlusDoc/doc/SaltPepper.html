	  <P> Many images have impulse noise. If the impulse is positive it is known
	   as Salt, and if -ve is known as Pepper. These are of one pixel dimension. 
	   Removing such noise aids many other types of processing. There are 
	   many approaches to eliminate this type of noise. The function SaltPepper uses morphology
	   technique to identify such noise and replace those pixels by average or 
	   minimum or maximum whichever is appropriate of the surrounding pixels.</p>
 
	  
	  <P> Option to elimiate  Salt only or Pepper only or both types is provided.  </P>
	  <P> Once the salt or pepper is identified it is replaced by average value
	   of nearest 8 pixels. If avg is selected as false then in case of salt 
	   noise the highest value of neighbourhood and for pepper the lowest
	   value of neighbourhood pixels are used as replacement values. </P>
	   <P> Feedback loops can vary from 0 to 10. This works only if avg is true.
	   Feedback times image is repeatedly processed usng previous output
	    as input. Practically beyond a value of 5 no significant change occurs.
		As averaging is involved some blurring occurs. </P> 
	  
	  
	  <P>All avisynth+ supported color space RGB, YUY2 and Planar  formats with 8, 16 or 32 bit depth may be input. In case
	  of YUY2 and Planar formats option to process or not for U and V planes is provided. This function is thread safe : MT_NICE_FILTER</P>

<BR>#Usage examples:- 
<pre>
ds = SaltPepper(img, opt = "both",UV = true)
ds1 = SaltPepper(img, opt = "salt",UV = false, avg = false)
ds2 = SaltPepper(ds1, opt = "pepper",UV = true)
</pre>
<BR> The image below input is on left and on right output with script 
<BR> SaltPepper(img, opt = "both",UV = true, tol = 0, avg = true, feedback = 3 )
