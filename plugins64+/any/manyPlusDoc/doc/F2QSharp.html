	  <p>F2QSharp function operates in frequency domain and requires for 32 bit avisynth+ 
	<a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3.zip"> FFTw3 32 bit dll</a>  or for 64 bit avisynth+  <a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3_64bit.zip"> FFTw3 64 bit dll.</a> As these dll s are not thread safe this function operates in MT_SERIALIZED state.
	  </p> 
	    
	  <p>Given the  estimate of blur present, F2QSharp function tries 
	  to sharpen the image through frequency domain inversion.</p>
	  
	  <p>In case of motion blur the line is assumed to be symmetric about origin, the 
	  end coordinates of blur line x and y specified will be extended to  -x, -y to get full line. In case of out of focus blur
	  the x coordinate is the radius of blur.</p>
	 
	 <P>All 3 color (planes) of RGB formats and   planar YUV444 if opted (set uv as true) are processed. Otherwise only luma (Y)  is processed.</P>
		
	<p>Inverting in frequency domain can lead to instabilities and to counter
	this white noise is added, which while stabilising reduces  effectiveness and so need to experiment and compromised.
	The radius of designed inversion filter in spatial domain can be specified. This by using a hamming function 
	reduces ringing at expense of sharpening. These two operators have
	effect on processed amplitude of the image, experiment to arrive at optimum scaling parameter for any particular situation.</p>
	
	<p>For some situations for a particular set of parameters the result may be highly
	focussing in parts and in other parts amplitudes may be zero. One such condition
	is given in the examples. One must be careful about such situations.</p> 
	
	<BR>Sharpening larger blur can produce noticeable ringing  especially at edges of image.
	Cropping result may be a solution.
<br> As the exact blurring PSF was known in the examples, the results look good. In real life blurring PSF is not known and so inversion likely to fail.	
	<p> The text file to read for user input psf must conform strictly to following :
	<br> 1.Must have number 1 in first line.
	<br>2. Second line first integer is number of values present in each row. The second value on this line is number of rows. A maximum of  16 X 16 rows and columns can only be specified, <br>Third line onwards PSF values in rows and columns. The values are separated by space. Entries are in floating point.</p> 7
