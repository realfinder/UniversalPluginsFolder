<p>
The functions in this plugin are very similar to those of TransAll. Mostly recoded for handling more bit depths and formats for Avisynth+. All functions are thread safe MT_NICE
</p>


<p>The TxPlus plug-in creates transition from one clip to another clip having equal frame width, height, 
pitch, color format. and similar Audio formats.  The scene will gradually form 
from the firs Clip to the second Clip during the specified overlap duration.  Audio of 
the first clip fades out while of the second fades in during ition. (24 bit 
audio is not accepted).. Brief description of all the functions within this 
plugin is given in the Synopsis. Around 150 distinct itions can be created 
with these functions. In the detailed descriptions typical images seen during 
ition are depicted.</p>

<p>Place the TxPlus.dll in the appropriate Avisynth+ plugin folder .  
A LoadPlugin call will be needed if the plugin is put in any other folder. 
As there are many functions in this plugin , 
it may be preferable to keep this plugin in a different folder and invoke loadplugin.
All parameters excepting input clips and overlap time,  have default values.</p>
<p>
<BR>A sample script may look like this :
<BR>
<BR>#LoadPlugIn("C:\............\All.dll")
<BR>A=avisource("C:\...........\xxxxx.avi")
<BR>B=avisource("C:\...........\yyyyy.avi")
<BR>#any desired ition call in place of Sprite below
<BR>Sprite(A,B,t)
<BR>Copy of my test script to check most of the functions is  after synopsis on this page.
</p>


<p>Avisynth+ r2247 or later supported all color formats ( excepting stacked) are accepted</p>

<b><a href="Synopsis">Synopsis of TxPlus plugin for Avisynth</a></b>
<BR>
<BR> <a href="docs/Accord.html"><b>Accord</b></a>: A Clip opens out revealing the B Clip or the B Clip 
closes over the A Clip in an Accordion Type folding. Single or Twin sections,
 openjng or closing, vertical or horizontal direction are the options.
 <BR> 
<BR> <a href="docs/Bloom.html"><b>Bloom</b></a>: B Clip blooms out of A Clip or A clip withers into B clip
<BR>
<BR> 
<BR> <a href="docs/Bubbles.html"><b>Bubbles</b></a>:Bubbles of B Clip randomly move on to A Clip and lock into
position.
<BR>
<BR> <a href="docs/Central.html"><b>Central</b></a>: B (second) clip emerges from A clip or A clip 
disappears into B clip. While emerging or disappearing the frame is resized 
to fit and or rotated by desired number of turns clockwise or counterclock wise.
<BR>
<BR> <a href="docs/Crumple.html"><b>Crumple</b></a>: This function crumples or fanfolds (as one does with paper) 
A Clip over the B Clip thus revealing B Clip or uncrumples (unfolds) 
B Clip over A Clip thus masking A Clip.
<BR>
<BR> <a href="docs/Disco.html"><b>Disco</b></a>: B (second) clip emerges over the A(First)clip or the 
A Clip disappears into B Clip as circular rotating Disks during ition. 
Radius of discs, Emerge or disappear and number of revolutions and direction of 
rotation are options.
<BR>
<BR> <a href="docs/FlipPage.html"><b>FlipPage</b></a>: A (first) clip is flipped either A or B or up or 
down as viewing in an album revealing B Clip
<BR>
<BR> <a href="docs/FlipTurn.html"><b>FlipTurn</b></a>: B Clip (the second Clip) emerges flipping vertically and 
horizontally and rotating while gradually replacing the A Clip. The number of 
times to flip horizontally, vertically, number of turns during effect, clock or 
anticlockwise are other parameters. Vertical and horizontal flips acan be 
considered as rotations about x and y axis, while turning is around z axis and 
therefore this is a 3d rotation ition.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Funnel.html"><b>Funnel</b></a>: This function funnels out(wraps around a funnel shape) the 
A Clip (the First Clip) and reveals the B(the second) Clip while moving 
in any of the 4 (up down, A or B) directions.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Marbles.html"><b>Marbles</b></a>: Over A Frame, B Frame appears as gradually enlarging 
circular disks. Magnification in the disks produces the effect of viewing through 
glass marble. If drop is true the magnification in the discs vary from center to 
edges, otherwise remain constant through. Radius of discs, magnification and 
whether drop effect is required can be specified.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Paint.html"><b>Paint</b></a>: This function, from pieces of B Clip frame, builds a fence 
or a brick wall or paint strips with brush strokes on A clip and 
completes the build by the end of transition.  
<BR>

<BR> <a href="docs/Push.html"><b>Push</b></a>: B Clip pushes out the A Clip in any of the four (up down,Left, Right ) direction.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Ripple.html"><b>Ripple</b></a>: A gradually increasing water ripple covers fully the   A Clip 
during 1/3  of transition (overlap) length. Thereafter the B Clip emerges in 
the center as a growing Ripple fully covering frame by 2/3 of overlap length. 
This ripple then subsides (withdraws) revealing the B Clip. The wave length 
lambda and wave amplitude can be specified.
<BR>

<BR><a href="docs/Ripples.html"><b>Ripples</b></a>: Gradually increasing two water ripples cover fully the   A Clip 
during 1/3  of transition (overlap) length. Thereafter the B Clip
 emerges in 2 ripples from opposite sides or positions and then the ripples subside. 
lambda and wave amplitude besides number and location of ripples 
can be specified.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Roll.html"><b>Roll</b></a>. A (first) clip rolls out revealing 
B Clip, or B clip Rolls in masking out A Clip.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Scratch.html"><b>Scratch</b></a>: B (second) clip gradually is revealed by scratching the 
A Clip image, in a desired style similar to scratch cards. Falling rain, 
tv noise, water fountain, laser beams, dust storm,  horizontal lines, 
vertical lines  are the styles currently available.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Shuffle.html"><b>Shuffle</b></a>: A (first) clip moves out on top, while B Clip moves 
from below in opposite direction halfway, then B clip moves back to the top 
position while A clip slides under in opposite direction resembling movement 
of shuffling of cards. Four directions (up down, A or B) of shuffling 
are possible.
<BR>

<BR><a href="docs/Slide.html"><b>Slide</b></a>: B (second) clip slides in over A Clip or A clip slides out. If center is 
selected then A clip disappears towards the center of B Clip shrinking 
in all directions or B emerges from center of A clip. Any of 8 directions or center can be opted.
<BR>

<BR><a href="docs/Sprite.html"><b>Sprite</b></a>: B (second) clip squeezes  out A clip thereby appearing  
like a rotating sprite, exhibiting different faces. Movement can be specified 
as any of four possible directions.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Swing.html"><b>Swing</b></a>: B (second) clip swings in or the A clip swings out as 
doors hinged at corners, thereby fully revealing or assembling the B Clip. 
The number of doors can be one (single door attached at the selected corner 
swings out or in), two (twin doors hinged at opposite corners swing) and four 
(4 doors each at a corner swing). 
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Swirl.html"><b>Swirl</b></a>: A gradually increasing swirl that covers fully the   A Clip 
by 1/3 overlap length is created. Thereafter the B Clip emerges in the center 
as a growing Swirl fully covering frame by 2/3 overlap length. This Swirl then 
subsides (withdraws) over the B Clip thus revealing it. The swirling can be 
clockwise or anticlockwise. The coarseness of  depicting swirl can be specified.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/TwinDoors.html"><b>TwinDoors</b></a>: Twin vertical or Horizontal doors made out of A Frame 
open or those made out of B Frame close revealing B Frame.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/VenetianBlinds.html"><b>VenetianBlinds</b></a>: In this transition   vertical or Horizontal slats open 
(as Venetian blinds do) revealing B Frame. Instead of linear blinds, checks 
or diamond pattern can also be opted. Pattern width can also be specified. 
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Weaving.html"><b>Weaving</b></a>: Interleaving together thin strips of B frame over the A 
frame the transition occurs. The interleaving styles options are horizontal, 
vertical, jigsaw puzzle and (basket) weave.
<BR>
<BR><a href="docs/Wipe.html"><b>Wipe</b></a>: B Frame wipes away A Frame in any of the  8 directions.
