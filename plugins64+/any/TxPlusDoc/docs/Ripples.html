	   <font color="#cc0033"><h1>Ripples </h1></font>
	 
	  <P>Two water ripples  from opposite positions( east and west, or north and south or north east and south west or north west and south east) of frame and gradually spread over the   A Clip during one third of  overlap length. During the next one third two ripples of the B Clip emerge from opposite positions of the A frame ripples and fully cover the frame.The two B frame ripples ripples subside during last one third of overlap. The 
	   wave length lambda and wave amplitude may be specified. Location of 
	   ripples centers 
	   
	   The speed of spreading of ripple over the frame can be specified. Lowest is 2 where 
	   the ripple spreads in half the number of overlapping frames, to a value overlap/3. 
		
 	   supports all avisynth+ supported formats and is thread safe </p>
