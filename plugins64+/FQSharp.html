	  <p>This plugin operates in frequency domain and requires for avisynth 
	<a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3.zip"> FFTw3 32 bit dll</a>  or for avisynth+ <a href="http://www.avisynth.nl/users/vcmohan/libfftw3f-3_64bit.zip"> FFTw3 64 bit dll</a> 
	  </p>
		<BR>plugin for avisynth versions  2.5 and 2.6 are in 32 bit, while for avisynth+ it is in 64 bit .
	  <P> Often video  images have 
	  three types of blur.<BR> 1. Blur due to relative movement of camera during
		the short time the shutter is open,<BR> 2. Blur due to subjects being out of focus 
		<BR>3. combination of both.</p>
		  <p>Amount of blur due to out of focus is dependant on the distance of the 
		  objects from the camera and likely to vary within same image.
		  Motion blur is dependant on the subtended angle of the objects and therefore 
		  will also vary. Restoring image from such blurs is almost impossible. However
		  in certain cases a large part of image may have a constant one type of blur.
		  This plugin may be able to restore such images.
		</p>
		This plugin has 4 functions.<br>
		1. <a href="FQBlur.html">FQBlur</a>	: produces either a motion blur or out of focus blur
		on an image or part of it.<br>
		2. <a href="FQRestore.html">FQRestore</a> : Restores image by unblurring, given the blur estimate.<br>
		3. FQVisual : Provides visual aid to estimate type and amount of blur
		present in (part of) image.In experimental stage. Presently not available<br>
		
		4. FQAutoFocus : Experimenting. Not available now. Restores out of focus image by refocussing automatically.
		
	  
	  <P> The frequency domain inversion implemented here can lead to instability.
	   Addition of  white noise 
	  and  limiting operator radius are included to contain ringing. 
	  Since these also limit other frequencies, the image luma level is 
	  affected. Corrective scaling can be applied. </P>
	  <P>While all 3 color
	  planes of RGB formats are processed, in case of YUY2 and Planar only 
	  Luma (Y) is processed.RGB formats may therefore 
		run slower as processing has to be performed on the three
		color planes separately.</P>
